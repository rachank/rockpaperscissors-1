        <p id="playinfo">Rock, paper scissors is a game that has its origins in China.
            Later, this game was transformed into its modern version while being played in Japan.
            It uses the three symbols of rock, paper, and scissors and has three possible outcomes of win, loss, or tie.
            Rock beats scissors, as it blunts or breaks scissors, scissors beat paper, as it cuts paper,
            and paper beats rock, as it covers rock.
            <br>In our game against the Cunning Computer, the player must choose one of the buttons of rock, paper, or
                scissors
                and then the outcome will be decided.<br>Good Luck!!
